# Ray Tracing Project
A computer graphics project that made in the second year in JCT.<br />
This project is used to render geometries in a scene.<br />
Simply, you place the geometries, the camera and the light sources and the program will render it to an image.<br />
There are also some great features, like anti-aliasing (smooth the edges of the geometry in the picture) and soft shadows.

## About Ray Tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.<br />
