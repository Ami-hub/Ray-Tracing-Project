# Ray-Tracing-Project
A computer graphics project that made in the second year in JCT.
This project is used to render geometries in a scene.
Simply, you place the geometries, the camera and the light sources, and the program will render it to an image.
There are also some great features, like anti-aliasing (smooth the edges of the geometry in the picture) and soft shadows.
